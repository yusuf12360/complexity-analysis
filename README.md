# complexity-analysis

A collection of time complexity proofs and logic for algorithms and data structures. Designed to provide a clearer understanding of algorithmic efficiency in Competitive Programming.

### Motivation
In Competitive Programming, we often use advanced algorithms because they are known to be 'optimal'. However, I personally find it difficult to implement these techniques with full confidence without first verifying their complexity from scratch.

I created this repository because I want to achieve **intellectual certainty**. By proving mathematically that an algorithm is $O(N \log N)$ or $O(E \sqrt{V})$ myself, I can ensure that my solutions are truly efficient and will pass within the given time limits. This process helps me turn 'black box' algorithms into tools that I fully understand.

* Treap.
* Mo's Algorithm
* DP DnC
